##Must Do’s:

* The Navigation must become sticky as you scroll down the page. Think back to Panty Guide / Bundle Tool you built.
* If the Font used in the PSD’s isn’t already a default WebFont or a Google Font, let’s find a Google Font that’s most similar. (It looks like the fonts being used are Lato).


##Bonuses:

* There is no Responsive Design with this template, but feel free to take a stab at it if you have time.
* You have creative liberty! If you have time to add animations or anything fun, go for it.
* Solve problems that the comp does not. For Example:
The Hero is awfully tall, but they have an arrow to convince the user to scroll. Is there a way to make the Hero flexible and adapt to how tall the Browser is?
